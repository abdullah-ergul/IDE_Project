# Code Editor Project

In recent years, we have become so dependent on the big companies that dominate the market that we continue to use these programs even when they leak our data. In order to prevent this, I have taken it upon myself to further develop the code editor I have made and present it to people and to stand against data breach, even a little bit.
I would like to present a few features of the code editor I made. The first of these is that it is designed for all software developers with its elegant and simple design. Furthermore, user-friendly features such as colorization and visualization of which languages are used and how often, make this a modern code editor.
